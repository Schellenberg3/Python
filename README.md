# Welcome!

This repository hosts several short python scripts that demonstrate a specific function or library. These are all little projects that don’t mean much on their own but are helpful for learning more complex python skills. 

The intent is that writing these is a way to practice and learn while keeping the code short and simple enough that it could be copied into new projects with minor edits. In short, this is just a bunch of quick reference python file that have helped me – and hopefully it can help you too!

Some code is borrowed from other sources and I try to attribute these in the files.  

Enjoy!
